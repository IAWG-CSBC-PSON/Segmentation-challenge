# Segmentation-challenge

### Getting started
We have set up some sample code using the [Allen Institute's Cell Segmenter](http://allencell.org/segmenter.html) framework.

The code is set up in Jupyter notebooks (readable in Jupyter Lab available within each instance during the hackathon).

#### To function properly you will need to correctly define `DATAPATH` 
Within each notebook, define `DATAPATH` as the top directory containing the example (or full) image datasets.
This currently works for an instance where the data were uploaded into the same directory as the notebook files. 
Please ensure you do NOT push any of the images to GitHub.
